## 📝 Development Status
- ✅ Scrape animations in lua scripts
- ✅ Scrape animation objects in the game file
- ✅ Fetch animation metadata, file contents, and asset types
- ✅ Upload multiple animations in a concurrent system; using [semaphore](https://docs.rs/semaphore/latest/semaphore/)
- ✅ Writing animations back to script source 
- ✅ Flags and user configuration for easy use
- ✅ Replace the animation instances in-game (Only replaces scripts for now)  
- ❌ Rename the Animations as the same as the ones it replaces (Requires extra API calls for scripts)

## 📦 Installation

1. **Clone the repository**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/animation-replacer-roblox.git
   cd animation-replacer-roblox
   ```

2. **Build the project**
   ```bash
   cargo build --release
   ```
> 🪟 For Windows users heres: [cargo install guide](https://doc.rust-lang.org/cargo/getting-started/installation.html) (to fix cargo not working)

3. **Run the application**

To run the tool, you’ll need your Roblox ``.ROBLOSECURITY`` cookie.
This is required to authenticate your account for uploading animations.

>    [!WARNING]
>    Never share your Roblox cookie. It grants full access to your account.
>    If you're unsure how to retrieve it, here’s a tutorial:
>    [How to get your Roblox cookie (YouTube)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zkSnBV7oOZM)
> 
> If you're concerned about using your main account, consider creating an alternate account, adding it as an admin to your group, and uploading from there.

You will also need to open Roblox Studio and save the game as a file for the Animation Replacer.
> [!NOTE]
> Recommended to use the ``--output`` flag to avoid data loss if the game corrupts. 

   ```bash
   cargo run -- --cookie "COOKIEHERE" --file "example.rbxl" --output "output.rbxl"
   ```

⚠️ Animations won't function in games owned by a group ⚠️

> [!NOTE]
> If you're uploading the game through a group, be sure to include the ``--group "GROUP_ID"`` flag.
>
> make sure the account has a LEGACY role with permissions to manage and create assets to avoid Bad Request

## 💻 How It Works
1. **File Scanning** - The bot automatically scans and identifies animations in the Roblox files
2. **Reuploading** - Each animation is processed and republished to ensure compatbility
3. **Completion** - Your game has working animations.

## ⚙️ Configuration
The tool requires minimal setup:
- **Roblox Cookie (REQUIRED)**: Your authentication token for accessing Roblox services
- **Target File (REQUIRED)**: --file requires the path of the file to scan
- **Group id (Optional)**: Upload to a group with --group flag
- **Output (Optional)**: Use the --output flag to avoid data loss
- **Threads (Optional)**: the --threads flag is how many concurrent tasks need to run (default is 5)

## 🚨 Important Notes

### Disclaimer
- Users are responsible for compliance with Roblox's policies
- Always ask/give credit to animators.
- Your Roblox cookie is only used for authentication purposes

For researching rust ive been using the official [rust book](https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/).

having AI (Claude) only help with ONLY the readme, lifetimes, and some refactors for optimization, as this is an educational project for me.
